### ðŸ§  Behind the Magic
This was my IPT HSC major project in 2021 - a chance to combine my love of Winx with web dev. Along the way, I learned:  
- How to craft interactive multi-page systems using HTML & CSS  
- Ways to embed videos and audio directly into webpages  
- The pros & cons of page-based navigation (and how SPA-style design could make it smoother)  
- How decision support systems help guide users in semi-structured scenarios
