# Winx Fairy Sign Decision Support System

This is a multi-page decision support system I created for my IPT HSC assignment in 2021. The system helps users discover their Winx fairy sign by selecting different options and navigating through pages.

## How it works
- Pure HTML and CSS-based navigation
- Winx seasons available to watch using YouTube embeds
- Background Winx music with a mute/unmute speaker button on the pages
- Be sure to check out the About page!

## What I learned
- Building an interactive decision support system using only HTML/CSS
- Embedding multimedia content like videos and audio in web pages
- The challenges of page-based navigation (and ideas for improving it with divs or SPA techniques).
- Concepts behind decision support systems from the IPT syllabus:
  - Supporting decision-making in semi-structured scenarios
  - Organising and processing user input for outcomes
